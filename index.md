I work at the [Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/ministeries/ministerie-van-infrastructuur-en-waterstaat) of the Netherlands. Currently, I lead a team of data scientist, Business Intellgence and automation. We work on various topics related to the mission of IenW.

I am experienced in the development of statistical and machine learning methods that can work in real-world applications. I worked as Data Science consultant ([BigDataRepublic](https://www.bigdatarepublic.nl)) in among others the financial (ING), telecom (KPN), flight (KLM).

During my academic years I worked as a post-doctoral researcher at [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl), and later at the [VU University Medical Center, VUmc](https://ctg.cncr.nl/). I worked on the statistical development of methods for the analysis of cancer genomics and the genetics of Neuroscience. My Ph.D. was at the [Erasmus University Medical Center](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/), Department of Hematology in colloboration with [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/) where I developed statistical methods for patient stratification with Acute Myeloid Leukemias.

My interest are especially in the statistics behind machine learning, and customizing models to let it work in real-world applications. As an example, we use deeplearning techniques for the detection of objects using satellite images or detection of trucks with dangerous goods. Currently, I am working on explainable AI, and causality models.
