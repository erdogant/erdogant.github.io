I am a Data Scientist at [Rijkswaterstaat Datalab](http://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl) in the Netherlands, working on applications with machine learning.
Before, I worked at ING, KPN, and KLM as Data Scientist consultant from BigData Republic [BigDataRepublic](http://www.https://www.bigdatarepublic.nl), 
As a post-doctoral researcher I worked at [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl), and [VU](https://ctg.cncr.nl/), and as a Ph.D. student at [Erasmus University Medical Center](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/), and [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/).

My interest are in a variety of topics in machine learning. Currently, I am working on causality models, and the challanges of getting models into production.
