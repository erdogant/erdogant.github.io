I am a Data Scientist at the [Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, dutch: Rijkswaterstaat](http://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl) of the Netherlands. I work on the (statistical) development, and applications with machine learning. Before, I worked at ING, KPN, and KLM as Data Scientist consultant from BigData Republic [BigDataRepublic](https://www.bigdatarepublic.nl).
As a post-doctoral researcher I worked at [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl), and [VU](https://ctg.cncr.nl/), and as a Ph.D. student at [Erasmus University Medical Center](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/), and [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/).

My interest are especially in the statistics behind machine learning, and customizing models to let it work in real-world applications. As an example, we use deeplearning techniques for the detection of objects using satellite images or detection of trucks with dangerous goods. Currently, I am working on causality models, and cyber security.
